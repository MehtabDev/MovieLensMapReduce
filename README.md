# MovieLensMapReduce

Implemented POC to analyze the movie lens data

Develop MapReduce programs to solve following KPIs:
1. Top ten most viewed movies with their movies Name (Ascending or Descending order)
2. Top twenty rated movies (Condition: The movie should be rated/viewed by at least 40
users)
3. We wish to know how have the genres ranked by Average Rating, for each profession and
age group. The age groups to be considered are: 18-35, 36-50 and 50+.
